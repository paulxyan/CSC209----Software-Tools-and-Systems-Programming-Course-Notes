"Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind." –Donald Knuth
"If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in." – Edsger Dijkstra
"The world would be a better place if more engineers, like me, hated technology. The stuff I design, if I'm successful, nobody will ever notice. Things will just work, and be self-managing." — Radia Pearlman, "the Mother of the Internet"
